        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil
                the grate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season chicken breasts with oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center
                and the juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An
                instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
                least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the grill and
                keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the chicken is cooking, heat butter and oil in a saucepan
                over medium heat until butter melts. Add garlic and saut√© until
                fragrant, about 2 minutes. Whisk in flour until incorporated,
                about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk in cream and broth; cook, stirring constantly until
                mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Add Parmesan and cream cheese;
                cook, stirring occasionally, until both have melted, about 5
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon sauce over chicken breasts and serve remaining sauce on
                the side.
            </li>
        </ol>
